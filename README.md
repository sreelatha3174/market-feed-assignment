explaining and use of the script

Prerequisites: python

Depedencies:
 
            The script itself does not have any external dependencies beyond the Python standard library.


Use:

  *Create a log file named log-monitor-py in the same directory as the script. You can use a text editor or the command line to create the file.
  *Navigate to the directory containing the log_monitor.py script.
  *Run the script by executing the command
        python log_monitor.py
   *Upon running the script
        Choose an option:
       1. Monitor log file in real-time
       2. Analyze log file
       3. Exit
    *Option 1: Monitor the log file in real-time.
    Option 2: Analyze the log file. 
    Option 3: Exit the script. 
 
  *To test the script,
       Add new entries to the log-monitor-py file while the script is running to see them being monitored in real-time.
       Modify the content of the log-monitor-py file to include different log messages for analysis.
       Use Ctrl+C to interrupt the script execution and verify that it exits gracefully.
